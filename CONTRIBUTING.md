# Contributing

## Wiki

See (and edit!) our public Wiki.

https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync/wiki/Contributing

I encourage you to create new pages or make helpful edits to all parts of the wiki. Try to ask before making major changes to pages you didn't create, but just do whatever you think is best. Feel free to make a user page and collect your notes there so everyone can learn.

## Slack

If you need any help or want someone to set up the workspace with you and get you stepping through code in your editor, make some noise in #contributors. Don't be afraid to speak up!

If you are looking forward to solve issues, you can select any issue you want but it would be great if you start with these issues, for these issues I will be specifically asking for help :

## Setup Extension Locally

```
git clone https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync.git
cd code-settings-sync
npm install
code .
```

Git and Node should be enough to run this extension. Execute the commands above and you will be able to run the extension in Code.
