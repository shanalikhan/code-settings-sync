## Configure Settings Sync


Settings Sync Configuration page will be opened automatically on code start and requires two things to setup:

1. GitHub Token
2. GitHub Gist Id

GitHub Token needs to be retrived by your GitHub account while Settings Sync creates GIST if you are first time user.

Following are the steps you need to perform to configure.

- Click on `Login with GitHub` .
- Login GitHub on Browser and close the browser tab once you get Success message.
- If you are using Settings Sync first time GIST will be created automatically when you upload your settings.
- If you already have GitHub Gist, new window will be opened to allow you to select the GitHub Gist or `Skip` to create new Gist.



![Login with GitHub](https://shanalikhan.github.io/img/login-with-github.png)


![Existing Gist](https://shanalikhan.github.io/img/existing-gist.png)


You can always **verify created gist** by going to `https://gist.github.com` and checking for a gist named `cloudSettings`

I will recommend you to read the configurations details [here](https://dev.to/shanalikhan/visual-studio-code-settings-sync-configurations-mn0).


### Gist Settings

Gist Settings are stored in `settings.json` file of Code.
You can customize the settings in gist settings like:

```
1. Configure Gist Id (Environment)
2. Configure auto upload / download for GitHub Gist
3. Configure extension sync behaviour
4. Configure force download
4. Configure force upload
6. Configure quiet sync
```

    "sync.forceUpload": false,
    "sync.quietSync": false,

2. Configure default Gist Environment name.
3. Replace the code settings after downloading.
4. Change the Gist description while creating new one in github.

## Features

### Toggle Auto-Upload on change

Auto-upload is **disabled by default**. When the settings are changed and saved this feature will automatically start the upload process and save the settings online.

Please make sure you have valid github Token and Gist available to make it work properly.

Select Command **"Sync : Advanced Options > Toggle Auto-Upload on Settings Change"** command to Turn ON / OFF the auto-upload.

### Toggle Auto Download

Auto Download is **disabled by default**. It will sync all the setting by default when the editor starts.

Select Command **"Sync : Advanced Options > Toggle Auto-Download On Startup"** command to Turn ON / OFF the auto download.

### Toggle Force Download

Force Download is **disabled by default**. By default, extension won't download the latest settings if you already have the latest downloaded version, but sometimes when you delete some extension locally and don't upload the settings it will still show that you have latest versions by date or time checks, by turning this ON it will always download the cloud settings on startup.

Please make sure you have valid github Token and Gist available to make it work properly.

Select Command **"Sync : Advanced Options > Toggle Force Download"** command to Turn ON / OFF the force download.

### Toggle Force Upload

Force Upload is **disabled by default**. By default, extension won't upload the settings if the gist has newer or identical content. By turning this ON it will always upload without checking for newer settings in the gist.

Please make sure you have valid github Token and Gist available to make it work properly.

Select Command **"Sync : Advanced Options > Toggle Force Upload"** command to Turn ON / OFF the force upload.

### Toggle Summary

Summary is **enabled by default** which shows all files and extensions that are added or deleted on a single page.
You may turn it off in order to make a upload and download process clean and quiet.

Select Command **"Sync : Advanced Options > Show Summary Page On Upload / Download"** command to Turn ON / OFF the auto download.


### Custom Sync

Settings Sync allows you to sync the files other from `User` folder. For example, your workspace settings and much more. Its upon you to utilize the full potential of Settings Sync across your machines or your teams machines. Read about custom sync [here](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync/wiki/Custom-Sync).

### Sync Pragmas

You can even manage which settings you want to ignore from being upload or download. Settings Sync even allows you to manage your `home` and `office` computer specific settings even OS related settings in single GitHub Gist. Read details about [Sync Pragmas here](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync/wiki/Sync-Pragmas).
