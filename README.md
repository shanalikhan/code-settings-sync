## Upload Your Settings For the first time

**Press Shift + Alt + U it will ask your GitHub account access token.**

> Type ">Sync" In Command Palette into order download / upload

This will automatically open your GitHub settings page, allowing you to generate a new token for the application, as explained in the previous section. This token will allow the extension to create gists.

Enter the GitHub token in the window and click enter.

**Upload your settings automatically and the extension gives you Gist ID in the system message.**
Gist ID is needed to access the data you have uploaded with your token. Copy this Gist ID in order to download the settings to other machines.

## Reset Token / Gist Settings

> Type ">Sync" In Command Palette and select Reset Token and Gist Settings


## Toggle Auto Download

Auto Download is **disabled by default**. It will sync all the setting by default when the editor starts.
Please make sure you have valid github Token and Gist available to make it work properly.

Select Command **"Sync : Advanced Options > Toggle Auto-Download On Startup"** command to Turn ON / OFF the auto download.

## Toggle Force Download

Force Download is **disabled by default**. By default, extension won't download the latest settings if you already have the latest downloaded version, but sometimes when you delete some extension locally and don't upload the settings it will still show that you have latest versions by date or time checks, by turning this ON it will always download the cloud settings on startup.

Please make sure you have valid github Token and Gist available to make it work properly.

Select Command **"Sync : Advanced Options > Toggle Force Download"** command to Turn ON / OFF the force download.

## Toggle Auto-Upload on change

Auto-upload is **disabled by default**. When the settings are changed and saved this feature will automatically start the upload process and save the settings online.

Please make sure you have valid github Token and Gist available to make it work properly.

Select Command **"Sync : Advanced Options > Toggle Auto-Upload on Settings Change"** command to Turn ON / OFF the auto-upload.


## Toggle Summary

Summary is **enabled by default** which shows all files and extensions that are added or deleted on a single page.
You may turn it off in order to make a upload and download process clean and quiet.

Select Command **"Sync : Advanced Options > Show Summary Page On Upload / Download"** command to Turn ON / OFF the auto download.

## Create Public Gist To Share Settings

By default, it creates secret Gist so only you can see it but if you want to share your Gist with other users, you can set it to public.
You can't change the exiting Gist type from secret to public so it will reset the Gist ID so you can create new Gist with all existing editor settings.

Select Command **"Sync : Advanced Options > Share Settings with Public GIST"**

Other users can give your Gist Id to download the Gist, but they can't upload their settings on your Gist.

    "sync.lastUpload": "2018-03-04T14:21:39.841Z",

## Customized Sync

Extension will create the `syncLocalSettings.json` inside `User` folder upon code start. <br>
On Windows, this is `%APPDATA%\Code\User\syncLocalSettings.json`. <br>
Mac, `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/syncLocalSettings.json`. <br>
Linux, `~/.config/Code/User/syncLocalSettings.json`. <br>

You can customize the sync:

```
1. Options by which files / folders and settings to exclude from upload.
2. The Gist Description when creating new Gist.
3. Replace the code settings after downloading.
4. Change the Gist description while creating new one in github.
```

The JSON will be created as:

```json
{
    "ignoreUploadFiles": [ "projects.json", "projects_cache_vscode.json",
        "projects_cache_git.json", "projects_cache_svn.json", "gpm_projects.json",
        "gpm-recentItems.json"
    ],
    "ignoreUploadFolders": [

    },
    "gistDescription": "Visual Studio Code Settings Sync Gist",
    "version": 290,
    "token": "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE",
    "downloadPublicGist": false,
    "supportedFileExtensions": [
